            <h3>what</h3>
            <h3>happened?</h3>
            <p>The 2nd of November 1988, marked a turning point in the history of computer security when Robert Morris
                unleashed a program known as a worm on to the internet from a computer at the Massachusetts Institute of
                Technology. In a matter of time, this program propagated itself onto 1000’s of computers running on UNIX
                operating systems (Marsan, 2008). </p>

            <h2>how</h2>
            <h4>did it happen?</h4>

            <p>The Morris worm took advantage of
                vulnerabilities in three UNIX programs:<br>sendmail, fingerd and rexec.
                <br>
                The program consisted of a main program and a vector program that
                was
                designed with the aim of gaining a foothold in as many machines while going unnoticed (Orman, 2003).
                However, the flaws contained within the program made this impossible.
                <br>
                Although the code was supposed to self-destruct on infection and prevent reinfection,
                an error in the code caused this step to be skipped 1 in 7 times, as a result it continued to
                create multiple copies that resulted in too many incoming requests that used up too many system
                resources. As a result this led to 10% of the computers connected to the network being
                forcibly shutdown (Spafford, 2018).

            <h4>what was the</h4>
            <h2>cost?</h2>
            <p>Back in 1988, the internet was drastically different from
                the internet we know now. Hence, it was mostly used by government organizations and universities to
                share information. There was also very little concern regarding security on the internet and in the UNIX
                operating systems. <br><br>Consequently, 6000 computers connected were infected by the worm resulting in
                damages
                worth $100,000 (The Morris Worm, 2018).</p>

            <h3>what were the</h3>
            <h2>lessons learnt?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Exposed the vulnerabilities of the internet and in 3 major programs in the UNIX operating system
                    (Orman, 2003).
                </li>
                <li>Exposed the lack of knowledge of system administrators in configuring the sendmail program which
                    exposed the system to unauthorized access.</li>
                <li>Led to the creation of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) which consists of a community of
                    experts on computer security who develop solutions for security flaws, provide information and
                    training on network, computer, and internet security (CERT, n.d.; Orman, 2003; What is a CERT,
                    anyway?, 2020). </li>
                <li>Creation of firewalls that were designed to prevent unauthorized access to computers and the
                    networks they are connected to (Orman, 2003).</li>
